This package provides the Terraform executable and cached plugins as a Calamari package.

The Terraform executable is updated by overwriting the `terraform.exe` file.

Terraform plugins can be saved in the `plugins` directory. These plugins will be used instead of the downloads from the Terraform website if they match the versions being requested.
